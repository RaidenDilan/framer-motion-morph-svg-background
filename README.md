### Approach

1. Model is built with using ReactDOM.createPortal.
2. Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. A typical use case for portals is when a parent component has an overflow: hidden or z-index style.
3. Initially I was going to use CSSTransition component from react-transition-group to animate the modal in and out.

### Blockers:

1. Using react-transition-group in React 18 has an issue. Issue is with CSSTransition component state transitions classNames.
